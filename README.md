# Proverbs-3-13-18
Blessings of Wisdom

13Blessed is the man who finds wisdom,

the man who acquires understanding,

14for she is more profitable than silver,

and her gain is better than fine gold.

15She is more precious than rubies;

nothing you desire compares with her.

16Long life is in her right hand;

in her left hand are riches and honor.

17All her ways are pleasant,

and all her paths are peaceful.

18She is a tree of life to those who embrace her,

and those who lay hold of her are blessed.
